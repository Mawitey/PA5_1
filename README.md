# Will the Customer Accept the Coupon.

### Problem statement
In the coupon csv file if there are some data that are empty. They need to be dropped. 
Also there are multiple coupons for different restaurants, bars, coffee houses and other places, so we need to figure out if how many of them are accepted.
We also need to find out the status of the customers that accept the coupons like their marital status, their occupation, their age and so on

### Results
So around half of the customers that get the coupon accept the coupons for different restaurants, bars, coffee house and more.
Most customers drive around when the temperature is 80 degrees

#### Findings
Around half of the bar coupons were accepted by the customers who got them
The acceptance rate of the bar coupons were much more greater for the customers who goes to bar 3 of fewer times than those who went more
The acceptance rate of the bar coupons for those who goes to the bar more than once and are over the age of 25 is very less
Similarly the acceptance rate of the bar coupons for those who goes to the bar more than once and had passengers that were not kid and had occupation other than farming, fishing or forestry is very less
When comparing the results of customers who go to bars more than once a month, had passengers that were not a kid, and were not widowed, and those who go to bars more than once a month and are under the age of 30 and those who go to cheap restaurants more than 4 times a month and income is less than 50K, the ones who go to cheap restaurants accepts more coupons

#### Next steps
In the future, I would incorporate the coupons with the gps, so before the customers start driving they will see the coupons in their gps. that way they avoid getting distracted while driving
